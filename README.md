# gentoo-build-docker
A Dockerfile for building a docker image for Gentoo from minimal install
Note that all that is being done here is building a docker image as a minimal install with a sub volume created and mounted to install stage 3 gentoo. Don't actually use this for anything else other than testing out installs.
